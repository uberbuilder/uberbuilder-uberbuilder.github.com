In short, I found that I can best meet my needs as a designer by designing the very tools that I use to design with, and that perhaps even more important than the tools we use is the very proccess we follow to create.  To me there is no difference between designing a website or designing a better way to build websites - they are both one in the same - they are *design*.\r\n\r\n## How to be the best Design-gineer-itect:\r\n\r\nThroughout the years I've noticed that the greatest of all designers always seam to live by the same set of core principals:\r\n\r\n0. They are visionary\r\n   - Always keep their eyes open.  They constantly process input from all the senses.  Every-day life is their research labritory.  They consume research on an epic scale.  This creates vision.\r\n1. Build, consistantly ship.\r\n2. Synchronously while they build they also write about why they build, how they build it and what they built (in that order).\r\n   - They write about **why** they build sometimes on their own blog but more importantly they always discuss why they build with those on their team.  Doing this always keeps them focused in the right direction.\r\n   - They write about **how** they build what they built usually in a teaching role.  They openly share with others any new techniques.  They often do this in a way so that they also get feedback on ways they can improve their own building process.\r\n   - They write about **what** they build which serves very often as a method of marketing.  However very often they do not do this from a point of view of \"marketing\" but more from the point of view of \"sharing\".  It is very important for these individuals to share with the world their life's work.\r\n3. Publicly Speak\r\n   - After they reach project milestones, they spend time to share it with the world.  Again, in the order of why, how, and what.\r\n4. Epic success is always accompanied by epic failure.  When you achieve on an epic scale, you also typically fail on an epic scale.  All of the greatest of the greats the world over learn their greatest lessons from their greatest failures.\r\n\r\n## What are my personal goals?\r\n\r\n- Constantly research, build and improve the tools required to develop and design websites.\r\n- Make every effort count: Build, and consistantly ship results.\r\n- Write about why, how and what I do synchonously as I do it.\r\n- Publicly Speak on a global scale.  I want to share what I do with the world.\r\n- Help others skip over the pain I have felt through my own design failures.  They will have their own :)\r\n\r\n## How working with the Яндекс on the core BEM team helps me accomplish my goals:\r\n\r\n- (Visionary+Build) The ability to connect with, work with and design with some of the greatest developers and designers of our era.\r\n- (Write) Document in well-written professional Native-English the core documentation of the BEM methodology and framework.\r\n- (Build+Write) Build and design realavant, ready-to-use-out-of-the-box block libraries that look good and give designers from all backgrounds a head-start on building the kinds of websites and web applications that they are interested in building.  Most importantly, allowing them to get started in a way where their work looks good right way with little effort.  I will build these block libraries to the highest level of standards.\r\n- (Public Speaking) In my opinion; only after the above two tasks have been completed is BEM ready for western and English based developers and designers to readily adopt these new practices into their own design processes.  Once we have that in position I have a personal goal to use my well established public speaking abilities to share BEM with the world on an epic scale.  I can use BEM to design websites for my own clients, and develop tutorials for others to do the same.  I plan on traveling all around the world to different conferences to speak about and share this technology with everyone.\r\n- (Overcome design failure) BEM is the greatest advancement in allowing web designer's work to not go to waste.  Too much of the time when we make a website is that work \"one-off\", meaning that we can only use that code and design once.  Now with the ability to have these highly re-usable, highly portable \"blocks\" we can not only have an easy to maintain library of blocks we have made but we can share them with others as open-source and get input and improvements from others as we share in our success.  We can learn from each other as we work with these shared and distributed blocks and libraries of blocks.  The more people who adopt BEM the stronger the fabric of the web.\r\n\r\n## Other bonuses:\r\n\r\n- I've worked in web design in both the western arena, and the eastern arena.  I have a unique experience, and thus perspective, that will help bridge the gaps between these two worlds.  I believe that BEM is the greatest advancement in web design since distributed open-source version control.  Now, we have highly-portable shareable website design code base that can be shared between developers/designers across networks, across companies, across the internet and most importantly across different cultures and language barriers.\r\n- I speak read and write fluently in Russian.\r\n- Because of my coginitive science background I have a very unique perspective on how to work with clients.  From the most early days of my education in web design I learned that \"if the application is hard to use, it's not the users fault.  It's the designers fault.\"  -  Because of this mindset, throughout my years of research, I have uncovered an epademic.  We almost always think of \"the client\" as an enemy, stupid, annoying and therefor worthless to the web design team.  This is obviously obseen, and obviously incorrect.  I have architected a design process that not only completely remedies this problem, but at the same time:\r\n   - Increases web development speed\r\n   - Reduces time spent teaching the client to almost *no time at all*\r\n   - Improves communication\r\n   - Simplifies the entire development to deployment process and therefor we get content back from the client even faster\r\n   - Improves the relationship of trust\r\n   - Gives the client needed training\r\n   - Allows the client to produce HTML5 complient, organically search-engine-optimized content without needing to hire a copywriter.\r\n   - Writing content for a website is now easier and faster\r\n   - Unlocks the secret, natrual elements of writing content to free us from the pain and suffering of the difficulties of writing for the web by allowing the writing process to be as fun and addicting as playing video games.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
