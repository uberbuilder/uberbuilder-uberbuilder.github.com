# Meeting Todo List

What needs to happen *before* BEM will have the opportunity to be adopted into the world market?

## Well Written Professional English Documentation:

(Written from a "Why" "How" "What" approach) - Friendly - From a **Finally somebody gets it** point of view.

- Core BEM Usage
- Core BEM Tools
- Core BEM Block Libraries
- BEM FAQ
- Simple BEM Tutorials
- Complex BEM Tutorials
- Re-Writing of some BEM Articles we have already published into professionally written English.  (Specifically the BEM article which introduces the history of BEM - Suggestion from *W. Scott Stornetta*)

## BEM Tutorials/Open Sourced Block Libraries:

- Blogging Platform
- E-Commerce Site
- Open-Source Project Page
- BootStrapBEM (We can make a "Boot" out of the BEM logo) - for the non-semantic solution. (Perhaps we consider this the "Entry" point for some developers who want to really slowly get their feet wet with BEM)
- Design a very aggressively-beautiful, modern, responsive-design based, BEM Style which offers more than one starting place for theming our open-source BEM blocks.
- How to Theme your BEM

## Our Message:

- We need to change how we talk about BEM to the public.  This "BEM is a methodology" is not setting us out on the right foot with our audience.  "BEM is *more* than a methodology" - Say that to yourself 10 times every morning before you get out of bed.
   - The reason why is because of books like [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) and methodologies like [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) have already been published and well consumed by both of the western and world markets.  Keep in mind that OOCSS and SMACSS are both 1. Outdated and 2. Not what BEM is at all.  Though BEM does solve all of these problems naturally.

# Questions For Vitali/BEM Team:

- Travel to Simferopol (Flight, Train, etc.) ... Reminds me of the old English phrase ***Trains, plains and automobiles!***
- Confirm: company computer, company policy, apartment finding assistance
- Have certain goals confirmed to be written into contract
   - After `documentation` and `design` goals are met, when will the first review be held to increase salary?
   - Company sponsored speaking events at conferences world-wide
   - What happens next? When will we sit down to have a review after we have accomplished the primary goals of our relationship?
